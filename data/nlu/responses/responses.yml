  utter_faq/nlu:
  - text: "Natural Language Understanding (NLU) deals with parsing and understanding human language into a structured format. 
    Rasa's NLU engine is defined by an [NLU pipeline](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/tuning-your-model#how-to-choose-a-pipeline) and trained on [NLU training data](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/nlu-training-data).
    Usually, an NLU pipeline will include components for:
      - Intent classification: Interpreting meaning based on predefined intents (Example: ‚ÄúPlease send the confirmation to amy@example.com‚Äù is a send_confirmation intent with 93% confidence)
      - Entity extraction: Recognizing structured data (Example: amy@example.com is an email)."

  ¬†¬†To learn how to create an assistant, check out the [Rasa Masterclass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlAQWbhwqLA).
  ¬†¬†There is one place where programming skills come in handy, and that is when implementing
  ¬†¬†[custom actions](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/core/actions/#custom-actions). You can create an action server in
  ¬†¬†Node.js, .NET, Java, or any other language and define your actions there. For custom actions written in Python,
  ¬†¬†we provide a small [Python SDK](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/api/rasa-sdk/#rasa-sdk) to make development even easier."
